- user request API:
permissions are not being set while creating user

-exclusion reason:
when spoc submits the tt, backend checks the region string in the ER although it does not exist therefore it
sends it to NOC by default.

:frontend:
pending and view if typed in url, it opens up.

<!-- spocvalidationDTO -->
@ApiProperty({ type: String, minLength: 8, maxLength: 255 })
  noc_remarks: string;
